# TODO

v0 is built and green. `spec.md` is the design-of-record; §15 lists what was
deliberately deferred.

- try a two-helper game (a builder plus a critic) and see whether the
  bot-to-bot dampening makes the second one useless in practice
- ask a helper to move flip-for-what onto the input module, the way space-racer
  went; then check whether either game wants a sound effect now that one can be
  made without leaving the studio
- second library, to prove `studio/` is a shape and not a special case for
  input.js — a sprite sheet reader or a sound player is the small end of it
- a studio-wide "which games are behind" view. Per-project the button already
  says Update; across games there is nowhere that shows it
- networked multiplayer: a turn-based room relay on the games origin — see
  ideas/next-five.md. The boundary rules it needs (no cookie, its own rate
  limit, caps) are settled and tested by the scoreboard now
- pull space-racer's colours out of its drawing code into `config/look.js` (a
  game refactor, so ask a helper to do it rather than doing it by hand)
- migrate `redwolf-radness` — still one big file, so this is a rebuild rather
  than a move (fun-slide went this way live: `2a6821d` in its repo)
- support touch controls
- ⚠️ before exposing this beyond a trusted group, revisit the v1 security list
  in spec.md §11: no CSRF token (bounded to logout now), in-memory lockouts,
  no rate limit outside login, and sessions that never expire or rotate
